# Food Waste Manager

CPE120 Flutter Project

## About the Application

Food Waste Manager is an application designed to assist small restaurants in managing their ingredients efficiently to minimize food waste. Poor ingredient management often leads to overstocking and expiration of items, resulting in unnecessary waste. This app addresses that problem with the following five main features:

1. **Homepage**:  
    - Display items that are nearing expiration.  
    - Shows ingredients that are low in stock.  
    - Provides a current count of ingredients in stock.

2. **Menu Page**:  
    - Calculates if there are enough ingredients for customer orders.  
    - Automatically updates the stock when an order is confirmed.

3. **Add Ingredient Page**:  
    - Allows adding new ingredients to the stock.  
    - Organizes ingredients by date to ensure the oldest items are used first, preventing waste.

4. **Menu Editing Page** (Under Development):  
    - Enables editing of the ingredients required for each menu item.  
    - Allows adding new menu items.

5. **Inventory Page**:  
    - Displays all available ingredients in stock.  
    - Shows the date and quantity of each ingredient added.  
    - Features a color-coded system indicating the freshness of ingredients:  
        - **Green**: More than 2 days to expire.  
        - **Yellow**: 2 days or less to expire.  
        - **Red**: 1 day left or already expired.  
    - Allows editing of ingredient details to correct any errors.

## Conclusion

This application is developed as a part of my university's CPE120 Flutter project.

Thank you for using Food Waste Manager. Enjoy my project!

Have a good day! ðŸ˜Š
